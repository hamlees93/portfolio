# Hamish Lees - Portfolio


[Portfolio](https://hamlees93.github.io/portfolio/ )
[Github Repo for Portfolio](https://github.com/hamlees93/portfolio)


## Purpose


This portfolio has been created as an easy way for potential employers to access my contact details, view my previous work, and find out a bit about me.


## Functionality


The website acts mostly as an informative site at the present moment. A user is able to navigate to the various sections of the site, via the navbar. This navbar is 'stuck' to the top, so can always be accessed.

As the user scrolls down the page, the various sections will transition into place, giving the feel of a dynamic site, to maintain interest.

Toward the bottom of the page, there is an interactive carousel, where a user is able to scroll through a slideshow, and view my previous projects, with a small description. These projects also act as links, where the project's github repo will be opened in a new tab.

At the bottom of the page, there are links to linkedin and my github page, as well as a mail link, that will open the users mail client, and prefill my email address and a subject line.


## Sitemap


The website is a single page scrolling site that is set out in the following order:

* Landing Page - An image of me, with a navbar at the top
* About Me - A section describing myself, and my skills
* Previous Work - A carousel showcasing some of my projects
* Contact - Links where the user can contact me

## Usability Considerations


* Alt tags on images
* Correct use of HTML tags, so that page can be navigated
