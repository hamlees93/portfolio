# Hamish Lees - Portfolio

[Github Repo for Portfolio](https://github.com/hamlees93/portfolio)


## Purpose


This portfolio has been created as an easy way for potential employers to access my contact details, view my previous work, and find out a bit about me.


## Functionality


The website acts mostly as an informative site at the present moment. A user is able to navigate to the various sections of the site, via the navbar. This navbar is 'stuck' to the top, so can always be accessed.

As the user scrolls down the page, the various sections will transition into place, giving the feel of a dynamic site, to maintain interest.

Toward the bottom of the page, there is an interactive carousel, where a user is able to scroll through a slideshow, and view my previous projects, with a small description. These projects also act as links, where the project's github repo will be opened in a new tab.

At the bottom of the page, there are links to linkedin and my github page, as well as a mail link, that will open the users mail client, and prefill my email address and a subject line.


## Sitemap


The website is a single page scrolling site that is set out in the following order:

* Landing Page - An image of me, with a navbar at the top
* About Me - A section describing myself, and my skills
* Previous Work - A carousel showcasing some of my projects
* Contact - Links where the user can contact me

Domains are effectively an address that internet pages are accessed through. Web server refers to server software, or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can serve contents to the World Wide Web. DNS, or domain name system, gives domains a human readable name, as oppose to the numbers and ports used to access them. Web browsers are used by people to gain access to internet pages.

All those objects are used in conjunction for users to access information with ease. A user will logon to a web browsers, and type in a domain name. The web browser will take that domain name, and direct the user to the correct domain, all behind the scenes. This domain allows the user to access, or interact with, the content uploaded by others onto web servers.

Facebook, one of the biggest companies in the world, is a prime example of the impact the internet has on our day-to-day life. Facebook has effectively created a new past time for people. Millions of people access their website on a daily, and often more frequently, basis. After creating a huge user base, facebook was able to start generating revenue from advertising and data collection on their users. 

From a small project, started in a dorm room, facebook has become one of the worlds super powers - although with plenty of controversy. From unethical psychological, to youth depression, to data mining, facebook has pretty much seen it all. Somehow though, people still put it at the centre of their lives and it continues to dominate
